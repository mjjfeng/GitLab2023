# GitLab2023

This is our first project for **Software Engineering IV**. We are to learn about the following:
+ github
+ git
+ how to use the above

I, Joshua Feng is to be the Repo Owner. This means that I have to write these 3 paragraphs as well as own a repo. I also have to create a repo to own and create a key so other group memebers can access said owned repo.

Victoria, my lab partner is to be the editing teammate. I'm not sure what they are supposed to do since we havent reached taht part of the lab yet. I'm assuming that she will have to pull the repo and edit it and then push back the code.

oh and we also learn about merge conflicts
